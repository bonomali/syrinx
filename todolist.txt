set directives are not included in the score AST.  They should be.
refactor score AST classes:
	put each class in its own file
	normalize class naming conventions (use capitals)
	rename classes to better indicate what part of the score they pertain to
	put score AST classes in their own folder
when there is a syntax error in the orchestra or score file, fail gracefully without core dumping.
error checking for when a score file mentions a function name that is not in the orch file.
